Idea: Bitcoin/Reddit project

Use historical data from various cryptocurrency APIs along with historical data from Reddit. Data scientists, companies, and the general public may all have an interest in understanding if there are patterns/correlations that can be identified between the sentiments expressed discussions on social media about various cryptocurrency and actual cryptocurrency exchange trends. My idea to first ingest massive datasets from Reddit as well as from 2 massive Cryptocurrency datasets. I would scrape the Reddit data for comments containing keywords related to Cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, etcâ€¦ I would also pull from the Cryptocurrency datasets the values showing frequency of exchanges and changes in the value of the Cryptocurrency. Using this pipeline a data scientist could, for example, perform a sentiment analysis on the Reddit comments to check if sentiment trends match with price trends.
